1. 
Modify it to show the population of Germany

SELECT population FROM world
  WHERE name = 'France'

SELECT population FROM world
  WHERE name = 'Germany'

2.
Checking a list The word IN allows us to check if an item is in a list. 
The example shows the name and population for the countries 'Brazil', 'Russia', 'India' and 'China'.

Show the name and the population for 'Sweden', 'Norway' and 'Denmark'.

SELECT name, population FROM world
  WHERE name IN ('Brazil', 'Russia', 'India', 'China');

SELECT name, population FROM world
  WHERE name IN ('Sweden', 'Norway', 'Denmark');

3.
Which countries are not too small and not too big? BETWEEN allows range checking (range specified is inclusive of boundary values). 
The example below shows countries with an area of 250,000-300,000 sq. km. Modify it to show the country and the area for countries with an area between 200,000 and 250,000.

SELECT name, area FROM world
  WHERE area BETWEEN 250000 AND 300000

SELECT name, area FROM world
  WHERE area BETWEEN 200000 AND 250000

1.
Read the notes about this table. 
Observe the result of running this SQL command to show the name, continent and population of all countries.

SELECT name, continent, population FROM world


2.
How to use WHERE to filter records. 
Show the name for the countries that have a population of at least 200 million. 
200 million is 200000000, there are eight zeros.

SELECT name FROM world
WHERE population > 200000000


3.

7.
Two ways to be big: A country is big if it has an area of more than 3 million sq km or it has a population of more than 250 million.
Show the countries that are big by area or big by population. Show name, population and area.

SELECT name, population, area
FROM world
WHERE population > 250000000 OR area > 3000000


8.
Exclusive OR (XOR). Show the countries that are big by area or big by population but not both. Show name, population and area.
Australia has a big area but a small population, it should be included.
Indonesia has a big population but a small area, it should be included.
China has a big population and big area, it should be excluded.
United Kingdom has a small population and a small area, it should be excluded.

SELECT name, population, area
FROM world
WHERE (population > 250000000 OR area > 3000000) AND NOT (population > 250000000 AND area > 3000000)


9.
Show the name and population in millions and the GDP in billions for the countries of the continent 'South America'.
Use the ROUND function to show the values to two decimal places.
For South America show population in millions and GDP in billions both to 2 decimal places.
Millions and billions
Divide by 1000000 (6 zeros) for millions. Divide by 1000000000 (9 zeros) for billions.

SELECT name, ROUND(population/1000000,2), ROUND(gdp/1000000000,2)

WHERE continent = 'South America'


10.
Show the name and per-capita GDP for those countries with a GDP of at least one trillion (1000000000000; that is 12 zeros). 
Round this value to the nearest 1000.
Show per-capita GDP for the trillion dollar countries to the nearest $1000.

SELECT name, ROUND(gdp/population,-3)

8. Pick the result that would be obtained from the following code:

Table-D

 lesson 6   The JOIN operation

1.
The first example shows the goal scored by a player with the last name 'Bender'. 
The * says to list all the columns in the table - a shorter way of saying matchid, teamid, player, gtime
Modify it to show the matchid and player name for all goals scored by Germany. 
To identify German players, check for: teamid = 'GER'

SELECT matchid, player
 FROM goal 
  WHERE teamid = 'GER'


2.
From the previous query you can see that Lars Bender's scored a goal in game 1012. Now we want to know what teams were playing in that match.
Notice in the that the column matchid in the goal table corresponds to the id column in the game table. 
We can look up information about game 1012 by finding that row in the game table.
Show id, stadium, team1, team2 for just game 1012

SELECT id,stadium,team1,team2
  FROM game
WHERE id ='1012'


3.
You can combine the two steps into a single query with a JOIN.

SELECT *
  FROM game JOIN goal ON (id=matchid)
The FROM clause says to merge data from the goal table with that from the game table.
The ON says how to figure out which rows in game go with which rows in goal - the id from goal must match matchid from game. 
(If we wanted to be more clear/specific we could say 
ON (game.id=goal.matchid)
The code below shows the player (from the goal) and stadium name (from the game table) for every goal scored.
Modify it to show the player, teamid, stadium and mdate for every German goal.

SELECT player, teamid, stadium, mdate
FROM goal
JOIN game ON (id=matchid)
WHERE teamid = 'GER'


4.
Use the same JOIN as in the previous question.
Show the team1, team2 and player for every goal scored by a player called Mario player LIKE 'Mario%'

SELECT team1, team2, player
FROM game
JOIN goal ON (id = matchid)
WHERE player LIKE 'Mario%'


5.
The table eteam gives details of every national team including the coach. 
You can JOIN goal to eteam using the phrase goal JOIN eteam on teamid=id
Show player, teamid, coach, gtime for all goals scored in the first 10 minutes gtime<=10

SELECT player, teamid, coach, gtime
FROM goal
Join eteam ON (teamid = id) 
WHERE gtime <= 10


6.
To JOIN game with eteam you could use either
game JOIN eteam ON (team1=eteam.id) or game JOIN eteam ON (team2=eteam.id)
Notice that because id is a column name in both game and eteam you must specify eteam.id instead of just id
List the the dates of the matches and the name of the team in which 'Fernando Santos' was the team1 coach.

SELECT mdate, teamname
FROM game
JOIN eteam ON (team1 = eteam.id)
WHERE coach = 'fernando santos'


7.
List the player for every goal scored in a game where the stadium was 'National Stadium, Warsaw'

SELECT player
FROM game
JOIN goal ON (matchid = id)
WHERE stadium = 'National Statium, Warsaw'


8.
The example query shows all goals scored in the Germany-Greece quarterfinal.
Instead show the name of all players who scored a goal against Germany.
HINT
Select goals scored only by non-German players in matches where GER was the id of either team1 or team2.
You can use teamid!='GER' to prevent listing German players.
You can use DISTINCT to stop players being listed twice.

SELECT DISTINCT player
FROM game
JOIN goal ON (matchid = id) 
WHERE (team1='GER' OR team2='Ger')
AND teamid <> 'GER'


9.
Show teamname and the total number of goals scored.
COUNT and GROUP BY

SELECT teamname, COUNT(teamid)
FROM goal JOIN eteam ON (id=teamid)
GROUP BY teamname


10.
Show the stadium and the number of goals scored in each stadium.

SELECT stadium, COUNT(*)
FROM game
JOIN goal ON (id = matchid)
GROUP BY stadium


11.
For every match involving 'POL', show the matchid, date and the number of goals scored.

SELECT matchid, mdate, COUNT(*)
FROM game 
JOIN goal ON (id = matchid)
WHERE team1 = 'POL' OR team2 = 'POL'
GROUP BY matchid


12.
For every match where 'GER' scored, show matchid, match date and the number of goals scored by 'GER'

13.
List every match with the goals scored by each team as shown. 
This will use "CASE WHEN" which has not been explained in any previous exercises.
mdate			team1	score1	team2	score2
1 July 2012		ESP		4		ITA		0
10 June 2012	ESP		1		ITA		1
10 June 2012	IRL		1		CRO		3
...
Notice in the query given every goal is listed. If it was a team1 goal then a 1 appears in score1, otherwise there is a 0. 
You could SUM this column to get a count of the goals scored by team1. Sort your result by mdate, matchid, team1 and team2.

SELECT mdate, team1, SUM(CASE WHEN teamid = team1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS score1, team2, SUM(CASE WHEN teamid = team2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS score2 
FROM game LEFT JOIN goal ON (id = matchid)
GROUP BY id
ORDER BY mdate, matchid, team1, team2
